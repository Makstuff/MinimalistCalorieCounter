## Play Store description

After trying a ton of different calorie counter apps, and disliking each and every one of them for different reasons, I finally decided to take matters into my own hand and learn how to code apps myself.

This app is exactly what I personally want and fits my every need, but I can understand that might not be the case everyone. Since it does not use any online food database and, except the small default database, relies entirely on data put in by the user, it takes a considerable amount of effort at the start. Also, while the interface is optimized for a minimal amount of clicks once you have learned your way around, this comes at the cost of intuitivity and might be another significant entry barrier.

My hope is that at least some people will enjoy this approach despite all its flaws, and will become happy long-term users.

## Tips and tricks

- Long-press a Quickselect tile (the 2x1 above the letters) to remove it from Quickselect.
- When you click on a Day, Database or Recipe entry to edit it, you also get the option to delete it.
- In the input screen with multiple text fields, in most of them the "Enter" key on the keyboard is replaced by a "Next" key that allows you to directly jump to the next text field. On the last text field there is a "Checkmark" key instead that acts as an alternate confirm button.

## Support

I would very much appreciate translations, as I am only able to provide English and German myself, so if you are willing to help out, just stop by. There's around 100 text pieces to tackle, and the time invested should be less than 1h once you are a little familiar with the app (as for myself, the initial translation from English to German took me less than 30min).
